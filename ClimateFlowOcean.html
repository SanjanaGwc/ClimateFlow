<h2 style="text-align:center;" style = "font-family:Montserrat "> 13% of the worldâ€™s oceans remain untouched by the damaging impacts of humanity. </h2>

<p style ="font-family: Montserrat"> Human activities such as overfishing, overharvesting, boating, and the impacts of pollution are currently harming the ocean environment. Activities not even related to the marine environment, such as agricultural runoff and coastal development, can also damage underwater environments. Currently, only one-eighth of the ocean is free of human impact (National Geographic). The impact on the ocean includes: coral bleaching (the Great Barrier Reef shrinking and dying), fish migration (moving towards the North and South poles due to ocean warming), ocean acidification (over-absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and leading to a lower pH), and more.
